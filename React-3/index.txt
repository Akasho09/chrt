## 
"State" is an object that holds data that can change over the lifetime of a component. 
React tracks this data internally, and when the state changes, it triggers a re-render of the component.
The state is local to the component and can only be updated by that component (although state can be passed down as props to child components).

# Re-rendering in react
It happens when
A state variable that is being used inside a component changes
A parent component re-render triggers all children re-rendering.
